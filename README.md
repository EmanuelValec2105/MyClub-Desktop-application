# MyClub-Desktop-application
Project made in college on subject "Development of software products" in .NET framework. We made, in team of 3 people, the application for sport club management. We made it using .NET WPF. I had to do 3 main things: 1. Training managment, 2. Attendances for every event. 3. Reports for played matches. You can look at Wiki for details.
Everything is on master branch.
